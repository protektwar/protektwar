- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexandru Herlas
- 👀 I’m interested in Exploring Technologies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of new things:
  - MIPS arhitecture and assembler programming (if you want to learn MIPS join our [MIPS learning server](https://discord.gg/nMEBYXvg6N))
  - SDR works/decodes waves to sound to information 
  - 3D printing (I build my own 3D Printing / CNC / Laser Cutter machine [Some of my designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/protektwar/designs))
  - 3D programming
  - CAN bus programming (Python CAN analyzer, not yet done -> I'm thinking to port it and continue development with C++ and Qt)
  - and many more 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects on the above topics.
- 📫 How to reach me https://www.protektwar.net
